parti da finire: 
questions to be done: 
1.2.6 suggest kernel that takes into account the node labels ( weis_--) , motivate
1.2.8 explain why the kernel without labels perform better or worse than the graphlet kernel
1.2.9 suggest another kernel from grakel that might perform well 

3.5.6 out of all the features, handcrafted and obtained from node2vec, why the selected features score better
